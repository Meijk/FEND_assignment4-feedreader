# Feedreader - a test-driven development project


## Project outline

The Feedreader is a simple application that outputs selected RSS feed entries on a single page. The project aims at implementing a test-driven approach of development. Taking advantage of Jasmine browser tests, the app uses test suites and expectations to check for functionality.

## Getting started

To inspect the Feedreader project download the repo and run the index.html file. After the page has loaded, you can find the Jasmine test results below the feedreader's entries at the bottom of the page. You'll have to be online for the feed to load entries and the test suites to be executed.
